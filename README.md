# Debugging

To get some information on what monk is doing, use the `monk-middleware-debug`:

```
npm install --save monk-middleware-debug
```

```js
db.addMiddleware(require('monk-middleware-debug'))
```

* If you wish to see what queries `monk` passes to the driver, simply leverage
  [debug](http://github.com/visionmedia/debug):

  ```bash
  DEBUG="monk:queries" npm start
  ```

* To see all debugging output from monk:

  ```bash
  DEBUG="monk:*" npm start
  ```

* You can also see the output from the mongo driver using `debug`:

  ```bash
  DEBUG="mongo:*" npm start
  ```

  There are several separated features available on this namespace:

    * Db: The Db instance log statements
    * Server: A server instance (either standalone, a mongos or replicaset member)
    * ReplSet: Replicaset related log statements
    * Mongos: Mongos related log statements
    * Cursor: Cursor log statements
    * Pool: Connection Pool specific log statements
    * Connection: Singular connection specific log statements
    * Ping: Replicaset ping inquiry log statements

  To see the output of only one of those features:

  ```bash
  DEBUG="mongo:Cursor" npm start // will only print the Cursor log statements
  ```
